# OctoPrint PSU Control - OPi.GPIO
This Fork of [PSU Control-RPiGPIO](https://github.com/kantlivelong/OctoPrint-PSUControl-RPiGPIO) brings OPi.GPIO support into [PSU Control](https://github.com/kantlivelong/OctoPrint-PSUControl) as a sub-plugin. You will need [PSU Control](https://github.com/kantlivelong/OctoPrint-PSUControl) installed and Octoprint running on a hardware supported by [OPi.GPIO Library](https://github.com/rm-hull/OPi.GPIO) in order for this to work. 

## Setup
- Install the plugin using Plugin Manager from Settings
- Configure this plugin
- Select this plugin as a Switching and/or Sensing method in [PSU Control](https://github.com/kantlivelong/OctoPrint-PSUControl)
- See [this](https://github.com/rm-hull/OPi.GPIO/blob/master/doc/install.rst#non-root-access) if you ran into the "Permission Denied" problem
